# The Icarus Revenge (Working Title)

*The Sweeps have grown long, I stand on this sodden rock and wait for the final duty to be done. Our wait has been long but soon our time will come, through either the completion of our work or the fire of our failure.*

"Grandpa!"

"What is it child, I'm writing my journal." groans the old man, long frizzled grey hair falling at the wayside and draping the floor.

"I got a huge booger out of my nose, look" a proud young child covered in equal quantities glitter and dirt proffers forth to the old man a noticeably large piece of congealed mucous.

"Wonderful child, go show your mother" huffs the old man and shoos the child away. It gives a shrill giggle and runs away from the large steel domed room the old man is seated in. He's seated in a straight backed wooden chair, a large and sprawling ornate oak desk in front of him is covered in reams of paper and in the middle of it all a Smith Corona from the early 20th century. Digitised and archived and refabricated now, in who knows when...long past keeping track of time in centuries.

He grabs the last sheet out of the type writer and reads it over

*melodramatic arseholery, try again tomorrow*.

He throws the sheet down and it ridiculously glides down onto a pile with all the others then gets up and heads out of the dome himself, the dome gives out onto a featureless stainless steel tube. These structures are ancient and had to be repurposed and reconditioned to their current use. The remainder of the work would not even happen here, they would board a ship to make a quick escape in the event of catastrophic failure in the final moments.

The old man came to another dome, 10 metres in all directions this one had been repurposed as a general living area. It housed a dining table, kitchen & living area. 3 more passageways broke off from this dome, each one labelled. Living Quarters, Greenhouse, & Airlock with the passageway the old man had come from being labelled Study.

A woman and a man were busy in the kitchen, pots boiling & the sounds and smells of grilled meat filling the air. "The child distracted me during a crucial part of my chronicling of our great endeavour, could you please keep it on a leash or something." The old man blurted out as he descended into a plush armchair.

"Oh don't be like that father, we sent the child to fetch you for dinner and you'll be glad to know that the protein synthesiser has been repaired. Tonight we're eating Steak." Four thick steaks sizzle and spit on the griddle and the old man begins to salivate.

"Oh my, it has been a few cycles, I suppose the child doesn't know any better. Here all alone without any peers to socialise with. Children really bring you right back down to the here and now. I don't know how many sweeps it's been since I was last around one."

"Really father? you can't remember the last time you might have spent an extended period of time around a child?"

The old man stares and thinks, his mouth opens and closes. He walks to the antique bar fridge and grabs a beverage. Opens his mouth as if to speak but then suddenly furrows his brow. "Not a clue, must be be a dozen sweeps or more then."

"Well you're not wrong, thought maybe there'd be a reminder that seems obvious to you but never mind, dinner is served come and sit." The mother gestured towards a table, Steak glistening and thick, aroma weaving it's way through the air and a large bowl filled with golden, crispy potato fries.

"I'm reeling, that smells and looks delicious. What's the occasion for spending the resources on getting the protein synthesizer fixed." The old man takes his seat at the table, a small circular affair with four chairs and a light pink floral table cloth. A single daisy in a thin white vase sit atop it.

The child is suddenly be heard screaming joyfully, coming from the direction of the Greenhouse tunnel and getting closer. the closer they get the more distinct the sound "Yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy!" She runs into the hall winded and falls on the floor breathing heavily, freshly caked dirt covering denim overalls. "It SMELLS SO YUMMY!"

"Yes dear, now wash your hands and sit at the table" The Father responds, the old man startles, having forgotten he was in the room. He now joins them at the table, with a bottle of wine and 3 glasses carefully gripped in one hand and a sippy cup in the other. He places first the cup then carefully the three wine glasses and finishes by pulling the bottle opener already embedded in the cork out of the bottle. "Can I interest you in a glass." He smiles at the old man.

"You asking is slowing down your pouring so just get to pouring already" The old man nearly shouts at the father pushing forward his glass.

Mom looks towards the old man, "Tonight dad we celebrate entering the final phase of the project. The last teams are aboard the ship waiting to leave. At this time tomorrow we'll be igniting Jupiter."

"So the time has finally come, you told me you'd get it done before I could finish my speech, meanwhile I won't be finished for another sweep. Congrats my girl, you're gonna cross off the list one of the last things our species will ever do for the first time. 4 millennia you've been at this task and now finally we're gonna do it, tow the earth and half the bodies of our solar system out into empty space. How close have you cut it?" The old man doesn't stop his speaking from getting in the way of his steak, have grabbed up his portion and cutting careful pieces to savour between his words.

The child lands heavily in it's chair and immediately grabs it's with both hands and savagely chews through it "Rawr I'm a dinosaur." She exclaims happily as she rips off a fibrous chunk and holds it in her mouth. 

"Yes honey, very nice, now be the kind of dinosaur that uses a knife and fork" says dad as he pushes a set of utensils towards the child.

"okay daddy!" exclaims the child and happily continues making dinosaur noises as they cut up their steak.

"We're not sure but we do know it's soon, a few solar cycles maybe even one or less. The surface is unstable and we thought we were too late many times already. If I'd been born 10 millennia earlier I would have finished this project already with time to spare."

"Such a hard burden child that you were robbed off 10000 years more of your immortality...which spans how long now?" Another savoured bite of steak for the old man.

"Oh you're telling me you've forgotten my age Father?" the mom exclaimed, not quite convinced in her outrage.  

"Yes I believe some time around your 4000th Birthday I decided to stop keep tracking, apologies if that makes me a bad parent."  

 And if to save the universe in that moment you'd need but a mole of sincerity, there would be none to be found.
